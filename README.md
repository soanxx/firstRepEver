Not sure how it works yet, I just want to host my first practice minigames 

This is my first project I did along a JS course. I made some changes from the original, tho.
It works like this:

It's designed for two players, split creen. Each player rolls a D6 dice. 
For each roll, you accumulate the points based on the value of the dice. 
Your goal is to reach 100 points and win the game. 
You only pass your turn if:
  1 - you chose to keep/store your current ammount of points.
  2 - you rolled 1 and lose all your current round points.
